      "description": "Built around a sun-soaked melody that feels like a warm beach sunset, this track layers dreamy bass and rich R&B guitar chords into something effortlessly hypnotic. Halfway through, the energy shifts — a jazzy, melancholic sample cuts through the brightness, adding a layer of depth and shadow before the groove pulls you back in.",

      "description": "\nWhat happens when Red Hot Chili Peppers crash a Michael Jackson session — funky, razor-tight guitars locked into a disco groove that pulls you straight to your feet. The track carries an intense energy, but a hypnotic looping melody and syncopated rhythm ease you into the pocket, making it impossible not to move.",
