      "description": "Built around a sun-soaked melody that feels like a warm beach sunset, this track layers dreamy bass and rich R&B guitar chords into something effortlessly hypnotic. Halfway through, the energy shifts — a jazzy, melancholic sample cuts through the brightness, adding a layer of depth and shadow before the groove pulls you back in.",

The track carries an intense energy, but a hypnotic looping melody and syncopated rhythm ease you into the pocket, making it impossible not to move.",

      "description": "This one is personal. Built on raw, driving rock chords that anchor everything above them, the track carries an angry, minor-key tension — the feeling of being pushed to your limit but refusing to back down. Layered on top, the melodies narrate the struggle, letting the emotions rise and fall naturally. The highlight is a shining, hypnotic guitar line that cuts through it all — catchy enough to pull you in and make the world disappear for a moment. The artwork was chosen deliberately, and if you look at it while you listen, you'll understand why.",
